To get access to the very latest features and bugfixes you have three choices:

1. Clone pyqtgraph from `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ with ``git``::

    git clone https://github.com/comimag/fringes
    cd fringes

   Now you can install Fringes from the source::

    pip install .

2. Directly install from GitHub repo::

    pip install git+git://github.com/comimag/fringes.git@master

   You can change ``master`` of the above command to the branch name or the
   commit you prefer.

3. You can simply place the pyqtgraph folder someplace importable, such as
   inside the root of another project. Fringes does not need to be "built" or
   compiled in any way.
