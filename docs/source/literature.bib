	abstract = {Deflectometry as a technique to assess reflective surfaces has now existed for some 40 years. Its different aspects and variations have been studied in multiple theses and research articles; reviews are available for certain subtopics. Still a field of active development with many unsolved problems, deflectometry now encompasses a large variety of application domains, hardware setup types, and processing workflows for different purposes, and spans a range from qualitative defect inspection of large vehicles to precision measurements of microscopic optics. Over these years, many exciting developments have accumulated in the underlying theory, in the systems design, and in the implementation specifics. This diversity of topics is difficult to grasp for experts and non-experts alike and may present an obstacle to a wider acceptance of deflectometry as a useful tool for research and industrial applications. This paper presents an attempt to summarize the status of deflectometry and to map relations between its notable branches. Its aim is to provide a communication basis for experienced practitioners and also to offer a convenient entry point for those interested in learning about the method. The list of references introduces some prominent trends and established research groups in order to facilitate further self-directed exploration.},

The profilometer is an advanced fringe-projection system that uses a calibrated LCD matrix for fringe-pattern generation, a hierarchical sequence of fringe patterns to demodulate the measured phase, and a photogrammetric calibration technique to obtain accurate 3-D data in the measurement volume. The setup in itself is mechanically stable and allows for a measurement volume of about 1x1x0.5 m3. We discuss the calibration of the sensor and demonstrate the process of recording phase data for several sub-views, generating 3-D point clouds from them, and synthesizing the CAD representation of an entire 3-D object by merging the data sets.},

              Phase measuring deflectometry (PMD) acquires the two components of the local surface gradient via a sequence of two orthogonal sinusoidal fringe patterns that have to be displayed and captured separately. We will demonstrate that the sequential process (different fringe directions, phase shifting) can be completely avoided by using a cross fringe pattern. With an optimized Fourier evaluation, high quality data of smooth optical surfaces can be acquired within one single shot. The cross fringe pattern allows for one more improvement of PMD: we will demonstrate a novel phase-shift technique, where a one-dimensional
              N
              -phase shift allows for the acquisition of the two orthogonal phases, with only
              N
              exposures instead of 2
              N
              exposures. Therefore, PMD can be implemented by a one-dimensional translation of the fringe pattern, instead of the common two-dimensional translation, which is quite useful for certain applications.},

            In dieser Arbeit wird eine Methode vorgestellt, mit der sich ein Schätzwert für das Phasenrauschen in optischen Messsystemen mit strukturierter Beleuchtung direkt aus den aufgezeichneten Grauwerten berechnen lässt. Das verwendete Rauschmodell basiert auf einer Richtlinie zur Charakterisierung von Bildsensoren (EMVA 1288), so dass die benötigten Parameter direkt einem konformen Datenblatt entnommen werden können. Alternativ wird in dieser Arbeit auch eine Methode beschrieben, mit der die Parameter ohne zusätzlichen Geräteaufwand experimentell ermittelt werden können.

	abstract = {Abstract We introduce a method based on the deflectometry principle for the inspection of transparent, rotation-symmetric objects with steep angles. Examples are intraocular or strongly curved, aspheric lenses. Usually, an additional reflection at the lens’ back side occurs and disturbs the signal. The solution is to use ultraviolet light which does not penetrate the material. As a consequence, static masks have to be used to encode the fringe pattern. A key feature of our approach is the specification of a spiral pattern, that meets the requirements for ultraviolet deflectometry with static masks. The spiral patterns are decoded by a multi-frequency phase shifting algorithm. We explain the principles of pattern design and present first evaluation results. Furthermore, we introduce a straight forward approach to obtain the absolute coordinates of the screen directly without any unwrapping. This facilitates the reconstruction of the three-dimensional shape of the lens in a subsequent step.},
